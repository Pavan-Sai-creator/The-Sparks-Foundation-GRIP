# Project Name: Social Media Integration

## About Me:

My name is Pavan Sai.K, I am a student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai pursuing B.Tech CSE with specialization in Cloud Computing. I had lot of enthusiasm to help people by developing android Apps. Now that I have spent enough time in learning, I want to combine and put all the pieces of information into action.

## Overview of the Project:

We need verified users for our application. But, verification is time taking process. Luckily tech giants like Google and Facebook have already done that upfront work for us. So, we can simply ask users to sign in with their existing social media accounts. This enables users to get started with our app quickly and makes it easy for developers to focus on tasks with higher priority.

This is a simple app which includes social media integration, developed as part of Task-1 of the Graduate Rotational Internship Program.

## UI and Structure:

- There are 3 activities in the App namely, **Main Activity**, **SignInActivity**, **DashboardActivity**
- The launcher activity is a splash screen that showcases the title of the program for a second and then navigates to SignInActivity.
- The SignInActivity displays **logo** of The Sparks Foundation and is equipped with **welcome message** and **2 buttons**, each for signing in with **Facebook** and **Google** respectively.
- On clicking on any of the buttons, the app navigates to **DashboardActivity** in which **profile picture**, **name** and **E-mail ID** of user are displayed on providing proper credentials. It also has a **sign out** button to log out of the account.

## Services Used:
    
I used **Authentication service** offered by Google's **Firebase**
  

## Fundamental Android Components used:

1. Activities
2. Implicit and Explicit Intents
